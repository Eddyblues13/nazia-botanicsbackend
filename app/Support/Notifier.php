/**
 * Sends storefront mail without ever letting a mail problem reach the customer.
 *
 * An order is a completed piece of business the moment it is written to the
 * database. If the mail host is down, the credentials are wrong or the address
 * bounces, the right outcome is a logged failure and a successful checkout —
 * not a 500 that loses the sale and leaves an order the customer believes
 * failed.
 *
 * Mail is sent inline rather than queued, deliberately: this store runs without
 * a queue worker, and a queued mail with nothing draining the queue is a mail
 * that silently never arrives. Should volume justify a worker, adding
 * `ShouldQueue` to the mailables is the only change needed.
